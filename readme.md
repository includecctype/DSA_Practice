## Hashing
Hash (converts data into hash-code, value after modulus is the index, value after divide is the data)

## Linked List

Linked List (structs containing data as nodes connected with other nodes via pointers)  
Linked Stack (LIFO, push and pop at top)  
Linked Queue (FIFO, push at tail, pop at head)  

## Sorting

insertion sort (shift the elements to the next column, insert the key element to the right space)  
selection sort (swap larger element with the smallest element discovered in the arr, or not if it is already the smallest)  
bubble sort (compare the current element with next element, swap if current element is larger)  
merge sort (split elements in the arr, merge them back while comparing them)  

## Searching

linear search (classic - loop through while comparing each elements)  
binary search (work with array where its elements are ordered properly, algorithm of comparing mid element)  

## Binary Tree
